# TopoPoint

This tool takes two coordinates and a step value, and returns the altitude of every coordinate from start to end distanced by a step.

## Userguide
* Download both the HTML file, and one of the scripts (Linux or Windows) to a folder.
* Open the HTML on a browser and follow the instructions there
* Run the script (On Windows, right-click the file and choose Run with PowerShell)
* There should now be a file named altitude.txt, with the data needed.


This tool is meant to be used in the Telecommunication Systems Project course from the TCE undergraduate, so it was designed within that context.
