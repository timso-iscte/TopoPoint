# TODO list #

* ~~Fix algorithm to find intermediate coordenates given two points and a step~~
  * ~~possible geodesic problem~~
* Change page lauout so that numbers don't overflow their column
* Implement requests to https://www.opentopodata.org/ to get altitude of a given point
  * Either GET or POST (tbd)
* JSON parser to get the altitude from the JSON object response
* Print to HTML the result in the intended result (__distance_from_starting_coordenate__  __altitude__)
